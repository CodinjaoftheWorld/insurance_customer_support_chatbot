Insurance,Term Insurance,Why you should buy a term insurance policy?,"Term insurance is often neglected compared to other types of insurance. The primary reason for this is the misconception that term insurance doesn’t provide high rates of return or any benefits other than the “Sum Assured” on the policyholder’s death.

However, there are several advantages of buying a term insurance policy. These include:

Term Insurance
Security in terms of finances: Term insurance plans are one of the most effective ways to create financial security. This is especially relevant in the modern era, as a term insurance plan safeguards the financial stability of the policyholder’s dependents should the policyholder die.
Basic insurance product: Instead of choosing a plan with dozens of additional benefits and paying an exorbitant premium, choose term insurance with a stable, low-cost premium for nearly the same benefits.
Greater returns: Term plans also cater to the needs of all types of investors. Term insurance provides better returns without the hassle of managing investment funds, as the return on investment is usually much higher than the money put in. Both the Regular plan and the TROP plan offer up to 105% returns on premiums paid at maturity.
Coverage in times of needs: Under term insurance policies, you can choose the sum assured so that it provides you with sufficient coverage. Financial experts say that sufficient coverage is equal to 10 times your yearly income. It is important to note that inadequate coverage defeats the purpose of insurance. Similarly, it is important for you to evaluate your insurance coverage and identify areas where you can reduce costs to avoid over-insurance.
Survival benefits: While a regular term insurance plan does not have any survival benefits, a number of insurers have designed plans, i.e., Term Return of Premium Plans (TROPs), that offer survival benefits in the form of premium refunds at maturity.
Policy term: Term insurance plans offers the policyholder with a fixed term coverage. This indicates that they can take term insurance for a fixed duration wherein their family is financially protected. Following this, they can retire comfortably.
Low claim rejection: Claim rejections are observed to be lower if a life insurance policy has been active for more than 10 years.
Flexibility -:Most term plans provide you the choice of purchasing the coverage in person or online. Additionally, if the amount assured under the plan is Rs. 50 lakh or less, many insurers do not require health examinations.
Riders: Term plans can be enhanced through the use of riders that offer extra protection. These riders can be bought from the insurance company at nominal costs. Some of the riders available under term plans are accidental death benefit, critical illness, partial or permanent disability, waiver of premium, etc.
Low brokerage: In case policyholder opt opt for an offline term insurance policy, they will be paying the lowest amount as broker commission. Brokerage is usually calculated as a percentage of the premium paid. Since the premium for term insurance policies are usually low, the overhead of broker charges is also reduced. If they choose an online plan, there will be no broker fees as well.
Flexible payment options: Term insurance policies offer flexible premium payment options, allowing policyholders to choose a payment plan based on their convenience. Premiums can be either limited pay, single pay or regular pay. Policyholders who choose limited or regular pay plans can pay their premiums either monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, or annually.
Choice of plan: A number of insurers offer policyholders a choice when it comes to the type of plan they wish to opt for. Policyholders can choose between single or joint life plans, depending on their need. They can thus choose to extend coverage for dependent spouses or choose a plan exclusively for the breadwinner of the family.
Tax benefits: Last, but not least, premiums paid towards a term plan is eligible for tax benefits under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. The death benefit received by the nominee under the plan is eligible for tax deductions under Section 10(10D) as well.

Insurance,Term Insurance,How does Term Insurance Work?,"A term insurance policy can be considered one of the most traditional forms of insurance. Most of the term insurance plans have a premium that increases in small amounts over a period of time. This is to account for a reduction in the value for money as years pass by. It also covers the increase in mortality risk and the extra levies imposed for a longer coverage term.

To understand how it works, have a look at it in these three situations:

Buying the policy: To be able to buy a term insurance policy you don't need to put aside tens of thousands of rupees every year. Many of the insurance policies can offer you a sum assured of up to Rs. 1 crore for a premium that could be as little as about Rs. 10,000 per annum (These are indicative figures. The actual premiums may differ depending on the sum assured and the insurance providers).
Keeping the policy: Just like any other insurance policy, you pay the premium towards these policies at a frequency chosen by you. These premiums can be paid every month, every quarter, every 6 months or once a year. They can also be paid as a lump sum instead of being paid at regular intervals.
Redeeming the benefits: Term insurance plans don't usually come with any maturity benefits. Term insurance plans don't typically come with any maturity benefits, except for term insurance with. Their main objective is to provide life insurance cover and that is exactly what they do. In case the policy holder passes away, the person who is named as the beneficiary of the policy will receive the sum assured.
The way it works is also one reason why you will notice that a lot of the time insurers refer to these plans as pure protection plans. There are no frills attached to the plan. You pay the premium and you get a fixed sum if case something happens to you."
Insurance,Term Insurance,Points to note while buying term insurance policy?,"Some important points to keep in mind while buying online term insurance are as follows:

Premium may vary in the future: The online price quote you receive is provided on the basis of an assumption that you carry normal risk in terms of health, occupation, and your family's medical history. After you submit all relevant documentation, the insurer may request you to undergo medical tests to arrive at the actual policy cost. In case the medical reports indicate that you are exposed to certain risks, the premium for your insurance may rise.
Do not let the policy move into lapsed status: The act of buying an online insurance plan is certainly a smart move. However, you should not let the policy lapse by missing premium payments. Since there would be no insurance agent reminding you of the premium payment due date, it is easy to miss renewing the insurance. It is advisable to send an ECS mandate to your bank so that the premium amount is automatically deducted on the due date. Setting up an alert on your mobile phone or computer is also a great way to remind yourself of the payment date.
Do not hide relevant facts while applying: If you are a smoker or use tobacco in any other form, your insurance premium will be 25%-30% higher than that of an individual who does not use tobacco. However, you should never hide this information in your application for insurance. At the time of a claim, if the insurer finds that the customer had concealed information, the claim will be rejected. The insurer may also cancel the policy, as applicable.
Your insurance policy is the backbone of your family's financial security. So, you should not get into a situation where the insurer annuls the plan.

Navigating this maze of policies and making sure you choose the one that fits best and meets your requirements is a difficult task.

The following points should be kept in mind when looking for a term insurance plan:

Reliability: It is generally advisable to consider the insurance company's reputation when choosing an insurance coverage. This is crucial since a term insurance policy is a long-term investment, and as a policyholder, you shouldn't be left behind if the company goes out of business or runs into problems. The FICO score of the business can be used to evaluate its stability and dependability.
Claim Settlement Ratio: The insurance company's claim settlement ratio serves as a measure of how many of the 100 claims it receives are ultimately resolved. Since a higher settlement ratio is viewed favourably, insurance companies with a strong claim settlement ratio are seen as more dependable and a better choice. The claims settlement ratio for each insurance company for a given year is made public by the IRDA.
Riders / Add-on covers: It is also important to take into account the riders that the insurance provider offers in addition to the standard policy. A secure insurance is one that includes both additional benefits and riders in addition to the standard coverage, and insurers that offer a large selection of riders are regarded as solid choices.
Cost: The amount you would be paying in terms of premium for the protection offered is a key factor in selecting a term insurance policy. Given that these policies can have a tenure of up to 20 years, the amount being paid annually as premium is a significant amount. Thus companies that offer reasonable protection for low premiums are preferred by policyholders.
Inflation: When selecting a term insurance policy, take into account factors like inflation. Term insurance policies are usually taken for 10-20 years, during which time inflation will erode the value of the rupee, resulting in lower returns at the time of maturity. To offset this, consider companies that offer plans where the cover increases by 5% - 10% annually to keep in line with inflation.
Policy comparison: It is advisable to compare insurance plans online so that you have a clear idea of the options available to you. The facility of policy comparison is offered by neutral third-party financial websites, free of cost. So, it is wise to make use of this facility as much as possible.
Engage an insurance advisor: In case you feel that you are unable to decide on a plan by yourself you can always seek the assistance of an insurance advisor for the same. This way you can be assured of expert insurance advice/suggestions that would enable you to pick the right policy.
Policy terms and conditions: It is vital that you read the terms and conditions within the policy document thoroughly before signing the dotted line. This enables you to understand the minute details pertaining to the inclusions and exclusions under the plan, so that there is no confusions in the future.

Insurance,Term Insurance,What Factors affect term insurance Premium,"When it comes to term insurance, there are several factors which affect the premiums which the insurer quotes on your policy. These factors are:

Age:Your age plays a major role in the premium you pay on your policy. The younger you are, the lower your premiums are likely to be and the older you are, the higher your premiums will be. It is always advised to purchase a life insurance policy when you are young.
Your family's medical history:If your family has a medical history of any critical or life-threatening illness/condition like cancer, diabetes, etc., then you will be considered a higher risk as compared to someone who does not have a family history of any major life-threatening disease/condition. A high-risk applicant will be charged higher premiums automatically.
Your health:Insurers will also look at the state of your health at the time you apply for the policy and also in the past. If you have been suffering from any chronic illness in the past or your current medical condition indicates any future health issues like high blood pressure, your policy premium rates might be affected. Applicants who are generally healthy often have to pay lower premiums in comparison.
Weight:People who are obese or overweight on the weight to height ratio scale may be asked to shell out more in terms of policy premiums as they carry greater chances of medical issues in the future.
Smokers:It is commonly advertised by insurance providers that non-smokers are eligible for special discounted premium rates on policies as compared to smokers. This is because smokers may be at a higher risk of cancer or other smoking related health hazards as compared to a non-smoker.
Alcohol consumption:Like smoking, alcohol consumption can also lead to health problems. Which is why insurers will enquire about your lifestyle habits during application as heavy alcohol consumption is linked to several health complications, increasing the applicant's risk.
Lifestyle habits:Those who often indulge in high-risk activities for leisure such as skydiving, bungee jumping, paragliding, hang-gliding or any other form of adventure sporting activity are seen as high-risk applicants and may be required to pay higher premiums. However, there are several insurers who have designed policies specially covering these high-adrenaline activities.
Applicant's gender:Insurance providers often advertise lower premium rates for women applicants as compared to men. This may be due to the fact that women usually have longer lifespans as compared to men."
Insurance,Term Insurance,How To Choose The Right tenure for Your Term Plan,"One of the main reason why term plans are preferred over other types of insurance plans is because it provides cover at affordable prices for a duration that the customer needs. However, when it comes to term insurance, how does one decide the term for which the plan should be taken? The right duration for a term plan will differ from individual to individual, depending on their unique financial situation. When deciding the term of a term insurance plan, you must consider the financial liabilities which your family may have to face if you pass away and how long it would take for those liabilities to be paid off. Some of the factors you must consider when choosing the term of your term plan are:

LiabilitiesLiabilities can come in many forms, such as loans or mortgages and must be paid in or before time to avoid penalty. When you choose the term for your term insurance, it is advisable to consider the time it would be required to pay off such liabilities. For instance, if you have a home loan which will be fully repaid in a period of 20 years, then your policy term must be a minimum of 20 years.
Commitments or Dependents If you have dependents like young children who are financially dependent on you, the term of your plan must ideally be the duration (no. of years) till your can children support themselves. You must also take into account milestone life events like weddings, or starting a career when deciding the term of your policy. Ideally these events must fall within the term of the policy so that in case you may not be around to financially provide for your family, their needs are still taken care of.
AffordabilityLong term plans are significantly more expensive than short term insurance plans. When choosing the term for your plan, you must first consider whether you are financially comfortable paying the premiums over a longer period of time or not. Long term plans provide cover for a longer duration but are more expensive. Short term plans are relatively more affordable and also provide cover for a sizeable number of years."
Insurance,Term Insurance,What is a Term Insurance rider ?,"Term Insurance rider is the extra cover a policyholder can opt for with their base term insurance policy to extend their coverage benefits. A policyholder can buy a term insurance rider by paying an additional premium amount.

Types of Term Insurance Riders
Most term insurance plans come with riders, which differ in terms of cost as well as terms and conditions. To understand types of term insurance riders in detail, read below:

1. Accidental Death Benefit Rider: With an accidental death benefit rider, one can avail an additional sum assured in case the insured dies in the misfortunate event of an accident. The additional sum assured is calculated on the basis of the original sum assured and may differ from one company to another. The premium remains fixed for this rider, for the entire policy term. However, some plans may put a cap on the maximum sum assured that can be availed.

2. Accelerated Death Benefit Rider: The family of a person suffering from a terminal illness like cancer, asthma, kidney failure, lung damage, etc. ends up paying a huge amount for medical expenses incurred due to the treatment. But with accelerated death benefit riders, the family receives a part of the sum assured in advance, which can be of great help in difficult times.

3. Accidental Disability Benefit Rider: In the unfortunate event of an accident, if the insured suffers from partial or permanent disability, then they can be benefited from this rider. Most of the time, term insurance plans pay you for 5-10 years after the accident causing disability, if you are covered under accidental disability benefit rider. Often coupled with accidental death riders, this rider can be treated as a source of income.

4. Critical Illness Benefit Rider: With a critical illness benefit rider, the insured can receive a lump sum amount on diagnosis of listed critical illnesses as specified in the policy document. Generally, term insurance plans cover you for cancer, stroke, paralysis, kidney failure, heart attack, major organ transplant, amongst others. The policy can either be continued or terminated after diagnosis of a critical illness, as per the terms and conditions stated in the policy.

5. Waiver of Premium Rider: As the name suggests, it waves off the future premiums in case the policyholder is not able to pay future premiums due to disability or loss of income. It can be said that this way you can ensure your premium payments until the policy gets expired. In case the insured does not have a waiver of premium rider, and suffers from a disability or is unable to pay the required premium due to some other reason, then the policy will expire and no death benefit will be paid as the premiums were not paid.

6. Income Benefit Rider: This is another useful rider that can be purchased by paying an extra premium at the time of policy purchase. Income benefit rider can be treated as a source of income in the misfortunate event of the death of the policyholder. With this rider, the family of the policyholder can avail additional income every year along with the regular sum assured, for up to 5-10 years.
